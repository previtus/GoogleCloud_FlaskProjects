# Following: https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/quickstarts/build-and-deploy

# First setup:

(install gcloud)
(make project XYZ on the https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector2/)
gcloud auth login
gcloud projects list # see the PROJECT-ID there
gcloud config set project PROJECT-ID


# Building
gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/PROJECT-ID/helloworld
gcloud run deploy --image gcr.io/PROJECT-ID/helloworld --platform managed
( allow unauthenticated invocations: respond y )
( will give you url to the project:  SOMEURL.run.app )

# Testing locally
#? (might need to download the credentials JSON as instructed by https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started)
#? export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="[PATH]"
sudo gcloud auth configure-docker
(then finally)
PORT=8080 && docker run -p 9090:${PORT} -e PORT=${PORT} gcr.io/PROJECT_ID/IMAGE
(but the building is not very fast ...)
